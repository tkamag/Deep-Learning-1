# Deep-Learning

This folder contains some introductory examples on how to use the deep learning frameworks **Keras** and **PyTorch**. These are, at least in my personal perception, the two most commonly used deep learning frameworks. 

They are written in a tutorial-like style so you can code along and follow my brief explanations. Some basic knowledge in python, linear algebra and machine learning is helpful.


In addition to these two frameworks, I also recommend **[Apache MXnet](https://mxnet.apache.org/)** with the Gluon API. A collection of tutorials can be found [here](https://gluon.mxnet.io/). The latter is especially useful to me with its time series modeling toolkit [GluonTS](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/opensource/gluon-time-series-open-source-time-series-modeling-toolkit/) when it comes to the use of deep learning models for time series forecasting. More on this topic can be found in my repo "RNN-for-Time-Series".

In case there are some problems with rendering the files, copy/paste the adress of the jupyter notebook in this [preview tool](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
